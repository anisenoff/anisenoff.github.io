        I'm incredibly lucky to be doing research in the <a href="https://super.cs.uchicago.edu">SUPERgroup</a> with Professor Blase Ur. My current projects are looking at breakage in browsers due to tracking protection, investigating the prevalence of password reuse here at UChicago, and trying to understand pin extension strategies. Yeah... It is a busy quarter.

        I'm in the process of designing a new online database of radio lightcurve data and updating/maintaining the <a href="https://astrobox.uchicago.edu/snax/">Supernova X-Ray Database (SNaX)</a> for Professor Vikram Dwarkadas in the Astrophysics department.

        Early in undergrad I worked as a lab tech in a geophysical sciences lab where I worked on collecting water isotopologue ratios in the atmosphere.

      	Way back in high school I did psychology research on project based learning and presented a poster at the National Association of School Psychologists with my collaborators (probably the thing that I am the most proud of to this day).
