    <h2>Photography</h2>
<p>
  I started taking photos way back in the dark ages (high school). My Nikon D750 (Digital) and Nikkormat EL (Film) are my go to cameras, but I have a collection of other antique cameras and will happily gush over their technical specs at the slightest provocation. Currently, I'm an editor for the photo section of the <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com">Chicago Maroon</a> (the UChicago college paper) where I get to take photos at various events around campus and Chicago. In my time on the paper some of the cool people/things that I have gotten to take photos of are <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2018/10/22/bill-hillary-chelsea-clinton-speak-closing-session/">Hillary and Bill Clinton</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2018/2/8/trudeau-nafta-canada-wont-cave-deals-better-bad-de/">Justin Trudeau</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/3/4/bernie-sanders-navy-pier-chicago-racial-justice/"> Bernie Sanders</a> (<a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/9/30/bernie-sanders-joins-chicago-teachers-eve-strike-a/">twice</a>), <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/2/15/subtlety-thy-name-urie/">Panic! At The Disco</a>, <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/9/11/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-talks-notoriety-fight/">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, and <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/11/26/sleeping-beauty-dreams-brings-new-life-tired-tale/">more</a>. My photos have been in the <a href="https://mag.uchicago.edu/university-news/model-students">UChicago Magazine</a> and I got an award from ICPA for my photos of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ANisenoff/status/1234207890522636288?s=20">UChicago Medical Center Nurses Strike</a>. I also take photos for campus clubs and for my own enjoyment.

  <h2>Embroidery</h2>
  <p>
    Embroidery has become a favorite pastime. It turns out that repeatedly stabbing a piece of fabric is quite therapeutic. I'm still getting a handle on my embroidery style but, in the meantime, I have been having a blast embroidering random logos.

  <h2>Crochet</h2>
  <p>
    I mainly create amigurumi versions of animals and video game characters. I love creating my own patterns and thinking about how my choices of stitches change the resulting shape of the object I am creating. The most ambitious crochet project I ever took on was a seven-foot-long coral reef for the admin building of my high school that showed the affect of coral bleaching. It has been used as a part of the "reef teach" project as a way to educate elementary school students about risks to coral reefs.

  <h2>Travel</h2>
  <p>
    I lived in St. Kitts for a while and have visited the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Bermuda, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Isreal, Italy, the Vatican, Hong Kong, Macau, Brussels, and Luxemburg. I was supposed to study abroad in spring 2020 but alas, the universe had other plans.
