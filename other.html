  <h2>Embroidery</h2>
  <p>
    Embroidery has become a favorite pastime. It turns out that repeatedly stabbing a piece of fabric is quite therapeutic. I'm still getting a handle on my embroidery style but, in the meantime, I have been having a blast embroidering random logos.

  <h2>Glass</h2>
  <p>
    Living in Pittsburgh has given me the opportunity to take classes at the <a href="https://www.pittsburghglasscenter.org">Pittsburgh Glass Center</a>. I took a flamework class on marbles and canes and absolutely fell in love with the process. I've mostly done flamework with borosilicate glass but I also did a fun workshop on soft glass flamework and kiln fusing.

  <h2>Quilting</h2>
  <p>
    Recently I've been making a lot of small quilts as gifts for my friends. most of my quilts end up being appliqu√©d with a sort of hawaiian quilting pattern.

    <br>
    I am particularly proud of the SUPERgroup quilt (the main research group I worked in during undergrad) I made during my gap year. I didn't have a sewing machine so it was entirely done by hand, had a ton of colors, tricky cutouts for the large letters, super dense embroidery for the smaller letters, was backed in passwords fabric, and had somewhere between 8 to 11 stitches per inch when I was doing hand quilting. It took about 145 hours and it was totally worth it for how it turned out.

  <h2>Crochet</h2>
  <p>
    I mainly create amigurumi versions of animals and video game characters. I love creating my own patterns and thinking about how my choices of stitches change the resulting shape of the object I am creating. The most ambitious crochet project I ever took on was a seven-foot-long coral reef for the admin building of my high school that showed the effect of coral bleaching. It has been used as a part of the "reef teach" project as a way to educate elementary school students about risks to coral reefs.

  <h2>Knitting</h2>
  <p>
    I'm pretty good at knitting. I mainly focus on knitting hats that involve a lot of cabling, but I've also made scarves and shawls. For the <em>Engineering Interactive Electronics onto Printed Circuit Boards</em> class I took spring quarter I designed a PCB to count and detect the types stitches that a person does. I'm trying to improve the design of the circuit for fun in my very limited free time!

  <h2>Photography</h2>
  <p>
    I started taking photos way back in the dark ages (high school). My Nikon D750 (Digital) and Nikkormat EL (Film) are
    my go to cameras, but I have a collection of other antique cameras and will happily gush over their technical specs
    at the slightest provocation. While I was an undergrad, I was an editor for the photo section of the <a
      target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com">Chicago Maroon</a> (the UChicago college paper) where I got
    to take photos at various events around campus and Chicago. In my time on the paper some of the cool people/things
    that I have gotten to take photos of are <a target="_blank"

  <h2>Travel</h2>
  <p>
    I lived in St. Kitts for a while and have visited the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Bermuda, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Israel, Italy, the Vatican, Hong Kong, Macau, Belgium, and Luxemburg. Hopefully I will get to do a bit more traveling post-pandemic, but I guess we'll see.
