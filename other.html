    <h2>Photography</h2>
<p>
  I started taking photos way back in the dark ages (high school). My Nikon D750 (Digital) and Nikkormat EL (Film) are my go to cameras, but I have a collection of other antique cameras and will happily gush over their technical specs at the slightest provocation. While I was an undergrad, I was an editor for the photo section of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com">Chicago Maroon</a> (the UChicago college paper) where I got to take photos at various events around campus and Chicago. In my time on the paper some of the cool people/things that I have gotten to take photos of are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2018/10/22/bill-hillary-chelsea-clinton-speak-closing-session/">Hillary and Bill Clinton</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2018/2/8/trudeau-nafta-canada-wont-cave-deals-better-bad-de/">Justin Trudeau</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/3/3/bernie-sanders-navy-pier-chicago-racial-justice/"> Bernie Sanders</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/9/30/bernie-sanders-joins-chicago-teachers-eve-strike-a/">twice</a>), <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/2/14/subtlety-thy-name-urie/">Panic! At The Disco</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/9/11/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-talks-notoriety-fight/">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/11/26/sleeping-beauty-dreams-brings-new-life-tired-tale/">more</a>. My photos have been in the <a target="_blank" href="https://mag.uchicago.edu/university-news/model-students">UChicago Magazine</a> and I got an award from ICPA for my photos of the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ANisenoff/status/1234207890522636288?s=20">UChicago Medical Center Nurses Strike</a>. You can check out all of the photos I took for the Chicago Maroon <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/contributor/alexandra-nisenoff/">here</a>. I also take photos for campus clubs and for my own enjoyment.

  <h2>Embroidery</h2>
  <p>
    Embroidery has become a favorite pastime. It turns out that repeatedly stabbing a piece of fabric is quite therapeutic. I'm still getting a handle on my embroidery style but, in the meantime, I have been having a blast embroidering random logos. If you want to see a very limited subset of the things I've made check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/allynisenoff/">Instagram</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ANisenoff">Twitter</a>.

  <h2>Crochet</h2>
  <p>
    I mainly create amigurumi versions of animals and video game characters. I love creating my own patterns and thinking about how my choices of stitches change the resulting shape of the object I am creating. The most ambitious crochet project I ever took on was a seven-foot-long coral reef for the admin building of my high school that showed the affect of coral bleaching. It has been used as a part of the "reef teach" project as a way to educate elementary school students about risks to coral reefs.

  <h2>Knitting</h2>
  <p>
    I'm pretty good at knitting. I mainly focus on knitting hats that involve a lot of cabling, but I've also made scarves and shawls. For the <em>Engineering Interactive Electronics onto Printed Circuit Boards</em> class I took spring quarter I designed a PCB to count and detect the types stitches that a person does. I'm trying to improve the design of the circuit for fun in my very limited free time!

  <h2>Quilting</h2>
  <p>
    I am just starting on my quilting journey. My first quilt was of a gray encoder. The front was made of black and white fabric with circuit schematics on it and the back was fabric with a PCB pattern from spoonflower. It was entirely hand pieced and quilted (mainly because sewing machines are expensive).

  <h2>Travel</h2>
  <p>
    I lived in St. Kitts for a while and have visited the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Bermuda, the UK, France, Germany, Canada, Isreal, Italy, the Vatican, Hong Kong, Macau, Belgium, and Luxemburg. Hopefully I will get to do a bit more traveling post-pandemic, but I guess we'll see.
