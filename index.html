  Hello! I'm Ally, a PhD student at the Carnegie Mellon, where my co-advisors are Lorrie Cranor and Nicolas Christin. 
  I am generally interested in usable privacy and security.
  Most of my research has been related to authentication or web privacy, but I'm always excited to learn about new areas of the field!



</p>
<p>
    
  Prior to moving to Pittsburgh I attended the University of Chicago where I majored in Computer Science (with a specialization in computer security) and Astrophysics. While there and during my gap year I was a member of the SUPERgroup where I worked with Blase Ur.
    
</p>
    
<p>
    I've also been very lucky to work with Nick Feamster, Yasemin Acar, and Vikram Dwarkadas.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not doing research I can be found doing some form of craft or photography, usually while listening to some random sci-fi show.
