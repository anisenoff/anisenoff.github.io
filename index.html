  Hello! I'm Ally, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University where my co-advisors are Lorrie Cranor and Nicolas Christin. 
  When people ask me what I research I tell them "usable security and privacy."
  Figuring out if that statement is true is left as an exercise for the reader.

</p>
<p>
    
  Prior to moving to Pittsburgh I attended the University of Chicago where I majored in Computer Science (with a specialization in computer security) and Astrophysics. 
  During undergrad and during my fabulous gap year I was a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://super.cs.uchicago.edu">SUPERgroup</a> where I worked with Blase Ur and several other professors that were willing to put up with me!
</p>
    

<p>
  When I'm not doing research I can be found doing some random craft project.
