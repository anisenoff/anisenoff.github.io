  Hello! I'm Ally, a third-year Societal Computing PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. My lovely co-advisors are Professor Nicolas Christin and Professor Lorrie Faith Cranor and my interests generally fall under the umbrella of web privacy and human factors of computer security/privacy. In the past I've done research on authentication and interface design.
  <!--When people ask me what I research I tell them "usable security and privacy."
  Figuring out if that statement is true is left as an exercise for the reader.-->

</p>
<p>
    
  Prior to grad school I attended the University of Chicago where I majored in Computer Science (with a specialization in computer security) and Astrophysics. 
  During undergrad and my fabulous gap year I was a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://super.cs.uchicago.edu">SUPERgroup</a> where I was incredibly fortunate to be advised by Blase Ur. I was also lucky enough to work with several other spectacular professors during my time in Chicago!
</p>
    

<p>
  When I'm not doing research I can be found playing with molten glass, yarn, fabric, or string.
