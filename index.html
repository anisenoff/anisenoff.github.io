  <!--I’m a PhD student at the University of Washington; Franzi Roesner and Yoshi Kohno are my co-advisors. My research
  focuses on the usability of computer security and privacy. I’m especially interested in how average users imagine,
  interact with, and are influenced by technology. Generally, I love asking people about what they love, what they hate,
  and anything else they feel strongly about.
  
  Prior to starting my PhD, I worked with Blase Ur at the University of Chicago.
  
  I was born and raised in Chicago (unless you’re from the city, in which case I was born and raised in the suburbs). I
  studied political science and computer science during my undergraduate degree, and graduated in June 2017.
  
  I now live in Seattle where I spend lots of time hiding from the rain with my two cats.

  Hello! I'm Ally, an incoming PhD student at the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science where my co-advisors are Lorrie Cranor and Nicolas Christin. 
  I am generally interested in usable privacy and security.
  Most of my research has been related to authentication or web privacy, but I'm always excited to learn about new areas of the field!

<p>
    I attended the University of Chicago for undergrad where I majored in Computer Science (with a specialization in
    computer security) and Astrophysics.
    
    While I was there I was fortunate enough to be a member of the SUPERgroup where I worked with Blase Ur.
    
    I've also been very lucky to work with Nick Feamster, Yasemin Acar, and Vikram Dwarkadas.

<p>
  When I'm not doing research I can be found doing some form of craft or photography, usually while listening to some random sci-fi show.
