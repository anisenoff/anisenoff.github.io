        This quilt is literally the most difficult, time consuming, awesome, thing I've ever made.

        I had wanted to try out the sewing machine that my parents had got me for my birthday so with the random scraps of fabric I had I made this quick little quilt. It is fully machine pieced and quilted. I ended up giving this small quilt to Dr. Austin Hounsel as a congrats on his new job at Apple.

        I made this small quilt as a congrats for Dr. Lucy Simko for successfully defending her thesis at UW. The logo was hand appliquéd, hand embroidered around the logo, and machine quilted.

        I made this small quilt as a congrats for Prof Max Gollaon getting a faculty position at CISPA. The logo
        was hand appliquéd and machine quilted. The front took about 8hrs and the rest took about 4 hours.
